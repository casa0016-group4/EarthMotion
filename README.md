Project Theme: 

Earthquakes - Climate Force 

 

Project Background: 

Earthquakes on Earth are a natural phenomenon, but they can have significant impacts on human life and property. Timely access to earthquake information is crucial for disaster management, early warnings, and public safety. IoT (Internet of Things) technology provides a new way for us to monitor seismic activity in real-time and convey information. By connecting to seismic monitoring data APIs, we can establish a real-time, global monitoring system for earthquake activities, enhancing our understanding of geological events. 

 

Project Introduction - EarthMotion: 

EarthMotion is an innovative project based on IoT and AR technology, aiming to achieve real-time monitoring and visualization of global earthquake activities through seismic monitoring data APIs. Here are the main features of the project: 

Global Real-time Monitoring: EarthMotion will connect to seismic monitoring data APIs from various regions, providing real-time information on earthquake activities globally. This enables us to promptly understand the distribution of earthquakes worldwide. 

LCD Display: EarthMotion is equipped with an LCD screen to display regions on Earth currently experiencing earthquakes. Through a clear graphical interface, users can intuitively comprehend the location and intensity of earthquakes. 

Physical Visualization Effect: The seismic monitoring data will be visualized through the opening and closing of physical gears. Different degrees of opening correspond to different magnitudes, offering an intuitive perception. 

Real-time Notifications: For significant earthquake events, EarthMotion will have the capability to send notifications, such as through an alarming buzzer, alerting users to take safety measures. 

Education and Outreach: EarthMotion is not only a practical monitoring device but also an educational and outreach tool. By explaining the principles and impacts of earthquakes, we aim to increase public awareness of Earth's dynamics. 

Through EarthMotion, we can make earthquake monitoring more visual, real-time, and understandable, enhancing societal awareness of geological activities and strengthening disaster preparedness. 

 

Ideas and References â€“ EarthMotion: 

Design Concept: The EarthMotion device will have a half-circle structure with internally connected gears. These gears will rotate based on real-time seismic data changes. 

LED Light Strip: An LED light strip on the outer edge of the half-circle will change color according to the severity of the earthquake, providing a visual indicator. 

LCD Screen: The LCD screen below the half-circle will display real-time earthquake information from various regions worldwide. 

Buzzer Alert: Include a buzzer that activates when the earthquake magnitude exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., level 3). 

Baseplate Illustrations: Illustrations depicting consequences corresponding to each level of earthquake, such as collapsing houses, will be displayed on the baseplate of the half-circle to enhance users' understanding of earthquake impacts.
